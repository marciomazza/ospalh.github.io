<p>As is often the case for hackers, there is
  an <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD comic</a> that explains the
  problem. A good passphrase consists of a number of randomly chosen,
  common words.
<p>What the comic does not explain is how to truly randomly select the
  words. The answer to that
  is <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">diceware</a>. It
  is rather simple, you throw five dice and look up words in a
  list a few times.
<p>The diceware website does provide these lists of words, but i
  didn’t really like them. There were two problems with the list:
<ul>
  <li>Formating was basically nonexistant,
  <li>and there were lots of non-alphabet characters.
</ul>
The problem i had with the non-alphabetic characters is that i have to
switch between systems with dvorak keyboard layout and programmer
dvorak layout. That makes finding any key but the letters quite
tricky.
<p>The solution was obvious: when the old lists aren’t good, i needed
  to make new ones.
<h2>The lists</h2>

There are four lists ready to download, the names pretty much tell
what is what:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ospalh/latex-diceware/blob/master/Deutsche%20Wortliste%20f%C3%BCr%20Diceware%2C%20f%C3%BCr%20W20.pdf">Deutsche Wortliste für Diceware, für W20.pdf</a>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ospalh/latex-diceware/blob/master/Deutsche%20Wortliste%20f%C3%BCr%20Diceware%2C%20f%C3%BCr%20W6.pdf">Deutsche
  Wortliste für Diceware, für W6.pdf</a>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ospalh/latex-diceware/blob/master/Diceware%20English%20word%20list%20for%20use%20with%20d20.pdf">Diceware English word list for use with d20.pdf</a>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ospalh/latex-diceware/blob/master/Diceware%20English%20word%20list%20for%20use%20with%20d6.pdf">Diceware English word list for use with d6.pdf</a>
    </ul>

<h2>Word origin and selection</h2> As the base for the words i
used <a href="http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/">BEOlingus</a> online
dictionary. They have a word
list <a href="http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/doc/faq.en.html">free to
download</a>, under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL v2</a>.
<p>I then munged that list in a number of ways until i had two lists,
  one <a href="https://github.com/ospalh/latex-diceware/blob/master/Engilsh%20word%20list.txt">English</a>
  one <a href="https://github.com/ospalh/latex-diceware/blob/master/Deutsche%20Wortliste.txt">German</a>,
  of short words consisting entirely of the lower-case letters a to
  z. From those i randomly picked 7776 words for the classical five 6-sided
  dice word selection and 8000 words for the three 20-sided dice word
  selection.
<p>This last selection means that there are some strange words in the
  list. Maybe i’ll pick words by hand at some later date.

<h2>On rolling dice</h2>

One point i’d like to reiterate is the ordering of dice when you roll
the five dice for a single word together. The diceware web-site does
mention that “(i)f you do roll several dice at a time, read the dice
from left to right.” You need strict rules how to order the dice. When
you just decide the order of the dice on the spur of the moment, an
import degree of randomness is lost.
<p>The procedure i use with six-dided dice is
<ul>
  <li>Always use a throwing cup
  <li>Shake it well for each throw
  <li>Throw the dice so there is room to move them away from you.
  <li>Dice stacked on top of others are counted first. Place them on
  the side, keeping the thrown value.
  <li>Then take a pen and push the dice away from you untill they are
  arranged in neat rows.
  <li><em>Now</em> read them by rows, then by columns, from top to
  bottom, from left to right.
  <li>If in doubt if it should “count”, throw again
</ul>

<p>The exact rules aren’t important. What is important is that there are
rules to decide the order.
<p>Another way to decide is to use five distinct dice, (one red, one
  white, one green, one big one small, ...), and have a strict order
  based on the dice themselves.
<p>For 20-sided dice, that typically come in a variey of colors, this
  method is more common. (Also, the method of pushing the dice untill
  they are in a row is harder to do as the D20 tend to roll rather
  then slide.) I personally have a blue, a white and a green D20 and
  use them in that order.

<h3>Forth and fifth rolls</h3>

Similarly, it is not important if the forth roll is used as the column
or as the row indicator in the word lists. But it should be done
consistently and decided before the first dice are thrown.
